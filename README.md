# Project Todos

This weeks assignment was to create a to-do list with react/redux. 
It needed to be able to add/remove todos and have a counter for finnished todos. 

## The problem

The struggle was more or less to grasp the concept of Redux, using the data in the slices and typing the
correct syntax for the reducers.
